# Documentation (/docs directory)

All extended documentation lives here. Root directory contains only 6 core documentation files.

## Structure

### Phase 1 (Current - Shipping This Week)
- **PHASE1_POLISH_CHECKLIST.md** - Testing & shipping guide (follow this day-by-day)
- **PORTFOLIO_ANALYSIS.md** - Portfolio strategy & talking points

### Phase 2+ (Future Development)
- **FUTURE_ROADMAP.md** - Complete specs for Phases 2-7 (40+ pages)
- **PHASE2_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md** - Ready-to-use Phase 2 specification

### Navigation & Context
- **ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md** - How all documents fit together
- **QUICK_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md** - Find what you need quickly
- **COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of work completed

## Root Directory Constraint

⚠️ **STRICTLY ENFORCED**: The 6 root documentation files are:
- README.md
- ROADMAP.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- PROJECT_STATUS.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md

**Rule**: NO new .md or .txt files in root. Everything goes here in `/docs/`.

## How to Use

### I want to ship Phase 1 this week
→ Start with `PHASE1_POLISH_CHECKLIST.md`

### I want to understand the project
→ Read `QUICK_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md`

### I want to build Phase 2
→ Use `PHASE2_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` as your spec

### I want to see all future plans
→ Read `FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`

### I'm confused about organization
→ Check `ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`

---

**Remember**: All future documentation additions go in `/docs/`, never in root.
