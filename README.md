### What's New in Phase 2

**Autonomous Planning & Execution Workflow:**
1. Describe a task: `/plan create a React component with tests`
2. Review the plan: See breakdown of steps (read, generate, write)
3. Approve execution: `/approve` to run all steps sequentially
4. Monitor progress: Real-time status for each step
5. Handle errors: Automatic retry or manual investigation

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- 🚀 Refactoring modules (analyze, generate, test, verify)
- 📝 Generating documentation (read code, analyze, write docs)
- 🏗️ Creating project structures (multiple files, configs, tests)
- 🔄 Multi-step code transformations (analyze, plan, execute)

## 🤖 Phase 2 Commands Guide

### Planning & Execution

#### `/plan <task>`
**Analyze a task and create a structured multi-step plan**

```
You: /plan create a React component with unit tests

LLM: 📋 **Plan Created** (5 steps, 8.3s thinking)

STEP 1: read
  Read example React components to understand style

STEP 2: write  
  Generate TypeScript React component with hooks

STEP 3: write
  Generate Jest unit tests for component

STEP 4: run
  Execute npm test to verify tests pass

STEP 5: write
  Create documentation for component

Ready to execute? Use **/approve** or **/reject**
```

**What it does:**
- Uses LLM thinking phase to analyze your request
- Breaks task into 3-10 atomic steps
- Each step is one of: `read`, `write`, `run`, or `suggestwrite`
- Generates step descriptions explaining the action

#### `/approve`
**Execute the current plan step-by-step**

```
You: /approve

LLM: ⚙️ **Executing Plan** (5 steps)

✅ STEP 1: read (127ms)
   Read example React components

✅ STEP 2: write (3.2s)
   Generated MyComponent.tsx (284 lines)

✅ STEP 3: write (2.1s)
   Generated MyComponent.test.tsx (156 lines)

⚠️ STEP 4: run (1.8s)
   npm test - Retry 1 of 2
   ✅ Retry succeeded, tests pass

✅ STEP 5: write (890ms)
   Generated COMPONENT.md

✅ **Plan completed successfully** (7.9 seconds)
```

**Features:**
- Executes steps sequentially
- Automatic retry (up to 2 times) on step failure
- Real-time progress with elapsed time
- Shows output for each step
- Continues on success, stops on unrecoverable error

#### `/reject`
**Discard the current plan without executing**

```
You: /reject

LLM: ❌ Plan discarded. What would you like to do?
```

---

### File Operations (Phase 1 - Still Available)

#### `/read <path>`
```
/read src/main.ts
```
Read and display file contents with syntax highlighting.

#### `/write <path> [prompt]`
```
/write src/greeting.ts write a TypeScript function that greets users with their name
```
Generate file content via LLM and write to disk.

#### `/suggestwrite <path> [prompt]`
```
/suggestwrite src/config.ts add validation for the API endpoint
```
LLM suggests changes, you review the diff before writing.

---

### Git Integration (Phase 1 - Still Available)

#### `/git-commit-msg`
**Generate conventional commit message from staged changes**
```
/git-commit-msg
```

Analyzes all staged diffs and generates a message following the pattern:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body with detailed changes]
```

#### `/git-review`
**AI-powered code review of staged changes**
```
/git-review
```

Reviews staged changes and provides:
- Potential issues or bugs
- Code quality suggestions
- Security considerations
- Style recommendations

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Why This Design?

**Three-Module Agent Loop**
```
User Request
    ↓
[PLANNER] → Breaks task into structured steps
    ↓
[REVIEW] → You see plan, decide to approve/reject
    ↓
[EXECUTOR] → Runs steps sequentially with retry
    ↓
[OBSERVER] → Monitors progress, provides feedback
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Planner → Executor Separation**
   - You always review before execution
   - Plan can be rejected without side effects
   - Clear visibility into what will happen

2. **Sequential Execution with Retry**
   - Each step runs to completion before next
   - Automatic retry (up to 2 times) on failure
   - Stops on unrecoverable errors

3. **Observable Progress**
   - Real-time output for each step
   - Elapsed time and performance metrics
   - Detailed error messages guide investigation

4. **Atomic Steps**
   - Each step is one of: read, write, run, suggestwrite
   - No partial execution or rollback needed
   - Simple state management

### Module Responsibilities

**Planner** (`src/planner.ts` - 366 lines)
- Analyzes user task
- Generates execution plan as JSON
- Validates steps are valid action types
- Returns readable plan summary

**Executor** (`src/executor.ts` - 503 lines)
- Executes steps sequentially
- Implements each action type (read, write, run)
- Handles errors and retries
- Provides progress callbacks for UI

**Extension** (`src/extension.ts` - 385 lines)
- Routes commands to Planner/Executor
- Manages webview chat UI
- Handles approval/rejection UI
- Orchestrates the agent loop

### Error Handling & Recovery

**Automatic Retry Pattern**
```typescript
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  try {
    return await executeStep(step);
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
    logRetry(step, attempt, error);
  }
}
```

**Error Categories & Handling**
- **Transient** (retry): Network timeouts, temporary file locks
- **Unrecoverable** (stop): File not found, syntax errors, permissions
- **Information** (continue): Warnings logged but execution continues

**Error Message Strategy**
- Always show specific error details
- Suggest corrective actions (💡 prefix)
- Include affected file paths and line numbers

## 🎯 Use Cases & Examples

### Example 1: Refactor Module with Tests
```
You: /plan refactor src/auth.js to use async/await and add comprehensive tests

LLM Creates Plan:
  1. Read src/auth.js (analyze current implementation)
  2. Write src/auth.js (generate refactored async/await version)
  3. Write src/auth.test.js (generate test suite)
  4. Run npm test (verify tests pass)
  5. Write docs/REFACTOR.md (document changes)

You: /approve
→ 5 steps execute in 12.4 seconds
→ All tests pass
→ Documentation created
```

### Example 2: Generate Project Structure
```
You: /plan create a new TypeScript project structure for an Express API

LLM Creates Plan:
  1. Read examples/project-template (reference structure)
  2. Write src/index.ts (create main server file)
  3. Write src/routes/api.ts (create API routes)
  4. Write src/middleware/auth.ts (create auth middleware)
  5. Write tests/api.test.ts (create tests)
  6. Write README.md (create documentation)

You: /approve
→ Complete project scaffolding in seconds
```

### Example 3: Implement Feature with Documentation
```
You: /plan add a rate-limiting feature to the API

LLM Creates Plan:
  1. Read current middleware structure
  2. Write src/middleware/rateLimit.ts (implementation)
  3. Write docs/RATE_LIMITING.md (docs)
  4. Write tests/rateLimit.test.ts (tests)

You: /approve
→ Feature fully implemented with tests and docs
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### 100% Local & Private
✅ **No external APIs** - Works completely offline with local LLM  
✅ **No cloud services** - Zero dependencies on external infrastructure  
✅ **No telemetry** - No tracking, analytics, or data collection  
✅ **No internet required** - After model download, works completely offline  
✅ **Your code stays private** - Never sent to external servers  

**How it works:**
1. Your LLM server runs on your machine (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)
2. Extension sends requests to local server only
3. All responses processed locally in VS Code
4. Your code, conversations, and tasks never leave your machine

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Cannot connect to endpoint"**
- Verify LLM server running: `ollama serve` or LM Studio UI
- Check endpoint in settings: `llm-assistant.endpoint`
- Test connection: Click status bar → "Test Connection"
- Check firewall: Port 11434 (Ollama) or 8000 (LM Studio) accessible?

**"Model not found"**
- List available models: `ollama list`
- Download if needed: `ollama pull mistral`
- Update settings: `llm-assistant.model: mistral`

### Performance Issues

**"Requests timing out"**
- Increase `llm-assistant.timeout` (default 60000ms)
- Check server resources: CPU, RAM, disk space
- Try smaller model: `ollama run tinyllama` instead of mistral

**"Very slow responses"**
- Use smaller model: `ollama pull orca-mini` (3.8GB)
- Reduce `llm-assistant.maxTokens` (default 2048)
- Check GPU acceleration: Ollama can use CUDA/Metal

### LLM Server Setup

**Ollama Won't Start**
```bash
# Mac/Linux: Reinstall
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai/download
# Then: ollama run mistral
```

**LM Studio Issues**
- Download latest: https://lmstudio.ai
- Load model in UI
- Ensure "Local Server" is started (green dot)
- Default port: 8000, check in settings
